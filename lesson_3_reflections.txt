When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

It would be useful to use a remote repository when you have to contribute
to your project from multiple computers, or when multiple people are working
on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's nice to know when changes are made to your local repository, otherwise
looking at your git log might confuse you if you haven't explicitly run a
git pull. Also, as it is effectively your private copy of the repository, it's
nice to be in control of it, and pull the latest changes when you need to.


Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks and clones are essentially the same thing. Forks are exclusive to
GitHub and are used to clone another persons repository to your account while
giving recognition to the original owner. A clone takes a full copy of a
repository either from GitHub to your local machine, or from your machine back
to your machine. You would use a fork when taking a copy of someones work from
GitHub, and a clone in every other situation when you wanted a copy of a
repository. A branch is used when you want to develop something for that
project while keeping a working copy of the project at the same time. For
example, for your changes to make any sense, multiple commits may be required
in order to successfully make all changes you want to make. You may be unsure
on how well a new feature of your project will work, and decide to make a new
branch in which you would commit several changes, which didn't affect the
original version until you were ready to merge the changes in.
