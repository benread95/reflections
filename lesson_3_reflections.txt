When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

It would be useful to use a remote repository when you have to contribute
to your project from multiple computers, or when multiple people are working
on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's nice to know when changes are made to your local repository, otherwise
looking at your git log might confuse you if you haven't explicitly run a
git pull. Also, as it is effectively your private copy of the repository, it's
nice to be in control of it, and pull the latest changes when you need to.
