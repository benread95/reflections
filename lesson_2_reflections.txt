What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initalising a repository adds a .git directory to the folder which will
hold all the necessary metadata for it to be a repository. You need to do it
in order to make commits and track the history of the files in the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area represents what files are ready to be committed. The value
it offers is that it lets you get all the files you want to commit ready and
arranged before you are sure you want to commit.
